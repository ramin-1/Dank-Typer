# Dank-Typer

Hello,

If you're a Danker looking to use this script, there are a few steps.

1. Make sure you have python installed on your computer.
2. Dowload this folder and save it to your desktop
3. To run the program, you need to now open a terminal/command prompt(Just search for it on your computer).
4. Inside the terminal type in "cd desktop/dank-typer" without the quotation marks, then hit enter.
5. Then type in python3 -i dankxpgenerator.py
- If you get this error('python3' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.) when doing step 5, try replacing "python3" with "python"
6. Make sure you have a discord window open to the channel where you will be running Dank Memer commands and click into the text box, because once you type in the command in step 5 the program begins in 5 seconds. 
7. Make sure you have enough laptops(10 should be enough if you run it all night) and cookies(2500) before running the script for long periods of time.
8. While running this program you unfortunately won't be able to do anything else on your computer.

What Does This Script Do?
- Runs beg, pm, gamble, slots, and sell cookie commands in a random order
- Make sure you have 2500 cookies in you inventory, because for every 2000 cookies sold, the bot will buy a new batch of ~2000 cookies for you
- The script will run 6-7 commands then say a random phrase, pause for ~10 seconds and then repeat this cycle.
- Due to the fact that each command is spaced using a random amount of time and commands are run in a random order, it makes it virtually impossible to detect by the bot's moderators.
