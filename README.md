# Dank-Typer

Hello,

If you're a Danker looking to use this script, there are a few steps.

1. Make sure you have python installed on your computer.
2. Dowload this folder and save it to your desktop(Click the green download code button in the top right and click dowload zip)
- Extract the files in your file explorer and move the file to your desktop for easy access.
3. To run the program, you need to now open a terminal/command prompt(Just search for it on your computer).
4. Inside the terminal type in "cd desktop/dank-typer-master" without the quotation marks, then hit enter. If you saved the folder in any place other than you desktop type "cd" followed by the path of where the folder is saved.
5. Type in `python -m pip install -U pip` to the terminal and press enter.
6. Type in `pip install pynput` and wait for the pynput library to be installed.
7. Then type in `python3 -i dankxpgenerator.py`
- If you get this error('python3' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.) when doing step 5, try replacing "python3" with "python"
8. Make sure you have a discord window open to the channel where you will be running Dank Memer commands and click into the text box, because once you type in the command in step 9 the program begins in 5 seconds. 
10. Make sure you have Make sure you have around 1000 coins in your wallet, at least 10+ lifesavers, 10+ laptops, and at least 1 pink before running the script for long periods of time.
11. While running this program you unfortunately won't be able to do anything else on your computer.

What Does This Script Do?
- Runs beg, pm, trivia, searches the air, uses pinks, and buys cookie commands in a random order
- Make sure you have around 1000 coins in your wallet, at least 10+ lifesavers, 10+ laptops, and at least 1 pink before running this.
- The script will run 6-7 commands then say a random phrase, pause for ~10 seconds and then repeat this cycle.
- In my experience, the typer will generate 300k+ coins every 10 hours.
- Due to the fact that each command is spaced using a random amount of time and commands are run in a random order, it makes it virtually impossible to detect by the bot's moderators.
